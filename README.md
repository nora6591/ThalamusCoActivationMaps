# ThalamusCoActivationMaps

In this repository (folder:Result) you can find the whole-brain thalamic co-activation maps that were created in our meta-analysis: 
"Flexible and specific contributions of thalamic subdivisions to human cognition" 
(Antonucci et al., Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews, 2021 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2021.01.014).
In our study, we performed a literature search on Pubmed to extract studies that investigated functional MRI activity
across several task domains and that reported results on the thalamus.
More specifically, our hierarchical inclusion criteria were:

1 article is in English <br />
2 article is not an animal study <br />
3 article reports original data == is not a review <br />
4 article reports a group of subjects == is not a single case study <br />
5 article reports results of neuroimaging on task-based fMRI <br />
6 article reports data of healthy group and is not reported only as comparison with disease<br />
7 healthy control group is in a baseline/normal condition (e.g. without medication)<br />
8 article reports coordinate-based results<br />
9 article reports whole brain analyses (i.e., no region of interest study)<br />
10 article reports coordinates meeting significance requirements (at least p < 0.001 uncorrected)<br />
11 coordinates report significant results located in the thalamus<br />
12 article reports coordinates in standard stereotactic (MNI or Talairach) space<br />
13 task taps one of the predefined cognitive processes of interest <br />
   (attention, working memory, long term memory – encoding, long term memory – retrieval, perception, social cognition, semantic memory) and contrast compares higher level with either lower level or baseline condition<br />
14 the study reports activation analysis results and not only connectivity results<br />
15 the study reports a sample size n > 9<br />

Overall, we included 93 studies that were parsed in different cognitive domains by 2 independent researchers separately.
Across domains 1945 participants were included (see below Flow-diagram).

To perform our meta-analysis we used the anisotropic effect-size seed-based mapping software 
(AES-SDM v.5.15 for Windows 64 bits, http://www.sdmproject.com; (Radua and Mataix-Cols, 2009; Radua et al., 2014). 
Details on this method can be found for example in Radua and Mataix-Cols, 2012.
